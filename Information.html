        <br><b>Dry Food: The Upside</b><br>
          <br>Dry cat food is available in conveniently sized bags, keeping well up to the "best by date" on the bag as long as you reseal or clip it tightly after opening. It's less expensive than wet too, and because it stores for longer periods of time, can be gentler on your budget.
          Some cats are perfectly content with dry food left as free-choice feeding, which is where you leave a bowl of food out for your cat to nibble on throughout the day. Other cats gorge on food and must be fed only portion-controlled meals. Luckily, you can easily use a standard measuring cup to control each serving for overweight or gluttonous felines.
          Dry cat foods such as Ideal Balance® offer an excellent mix of products your cat needs just as much as you do in your own meals.<br>
          <br><b>Dry Food: The Downside</b><br>
          <br>For cats with health conditions, dry food may not be as beneficial as canned partially because it lacks the water content that makes it easier to digest. This is where a consultation with your cat's veterinarian is essential, helping you choose the best food for her needs. Keep in mind older cats may have a harder time eating dry food than wet, especially if gum or dental issues have set in. Canned cat food's soft consistency may be easier for older kitties to eat than the crunchy kibble they ate at a younger age.</div>
        <div class="cont"><img src="images/qq.jpg"><br>
        <br><b>Wet Food: The Upside</b><br>
          <br>Wet cat food comes in canned, sometimes pre-measured portions that cats love. Cats diagnosed with certain medical conditions may also benefit from wet food. The higher moisture content in most canned products gives cats with urinary and kidney issues more water, according to PetMD, helping to flush urinary crystals more easily and reduce the risk of crystal formation as a result, as well as combating dehydration with kidney issues. Wet cat food may be a good way to help your cat stay hydrated if she has other health problems.<br>
          <br><b>Wet Food: The Downside</b><br>
          <br>There are disadvantages to the canned variety, though. Wet food generally costs more for its volume, so pet parents on a strict budget may prefer dry food to canned for supply reasons. Open cans need appropriately sized lids when storing them to keep them fresh and prevent odor from permeating the rest of the refrigerator (they should still be refrigerated to keep them from spoiling). Some cats dislike cold food, though, so you may need to put her canned food on a microwave-safe plate and warm it 3-5 seconds before serving. If your cat isn't particularly hungry, she may leave wet food scraps in her bowl or on her plate, which should be tossed after being out more than four hours.
          Also, if you have a long-haired or light-colored cat, you might be averse to feeding wet cat food because it can get on her whiskers and nose. But cats are meticulous groomers and will typically clean their own faces, and over time your cat should learn to be less messy of an eater. If you happen to have a cat that is a little lazier and doesn't clean herself as regularly, you might look into serving her food on a flat plate and purchasing some cat-safe wet wipes to help her clean her face.</div>
        <div class="cont"><img src="images/q1.jpg"><br>
        <br>Freeze-dried cat food is essentially raw food for your cat, packaged in an easy-to-prepare container. <br> While this may sound a little funky – we don’t like to necessarily think of our precious little kitties eating something raw.<br> It’s something that ties in rather well with their feline nature.</div>
        <div class="cont"><img src="images/qq1.jpg"><br>
        <br>Raw meat diets generally consist of various muscle meats, organ meats, and sometimes fruits and vegetables. <br>Some diets contain whole bones or ground bone while others do not. They can be homemade from various recipes (e.g., BARF or Ultimate Diet) and are also available commercially from a variety of companies. <br>Commercial raw diets are typically frozen or freeze-dried but some can even look like regular dry food (e.g., diets with a raw meat coating or kibble mixed with freeze-dried raw chunks). No matter whether they are homemade or commercial, they all have similar concerns.</div>
        <div class="cont">Clumping litter is frequently made with a clay base that pulls or clumps together into balls when wet. Cat owners can remove not only the feces, but the odor-causing urine as well. Different brands have various levels of clumping; some pull together tighter than others. This may be due to where and how your cat urinates in the box.<br>
          Some clumping litters are also easy for cats to track outside the box. Placing the litter box on a bathmat so the cat has to wipe his feet when he emerges might help reduce litter-track throughout the house.</div>
        <div class="cont">At about the same time that clumping litter was introduced, both clumping and non-clumping cat litters began to feature some sort of odor control. Some advertised that they contained baking soda, which would neutralize odor. Some experimented with enzymes. Today a number of litters advertise that they have controlled the odor problem; they all work with various degrees of success.</div>
        <div class="cont">"Crystal" litters are actually silicone-based litters that absorb urine, the moisture in feces and the accompanying odors. These litters are super-absorbent, so you don't need to use as much in the pan at one time. When the crystals' absorption capacity has been exceeded, cat urine will start to pool and it's time to change the cat litter.
          Some litters are a combination of clumping, crystals and deodorizing. Deodorant and crystal litters vary in how much tracking litter they create for cleanup, depending on grain size and paw adherence.</div>
        <div class="cont">Natural, biodegradable choices for cat litter include pine pellets, wheat and corn. These natural products neutralize odors right in the box. When the small pellets come in contact with urine, they fall apart into a sawdust like material that absorbs the odor. These products are frequently lower in dust and in tracking than other litters, so they may be a safer litter for cats that have respiratory issues or who are bothered by litter between their toes. Some brands may also be flushable, because the product is completely biodegradable.</div>
        <div class="cont">Another biodegradable option in cat litter is litter made from recycled paper. Paper-based litters are formed into large pellets that don't easily get caught in paw pads, making them fairly track free. The paper is also extremely absorbent and dust free, allowing them to control odor better than some clay litters.</div>
